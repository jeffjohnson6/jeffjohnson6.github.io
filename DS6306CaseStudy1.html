<h2>Address Missing values</h2>
<p>Address the missing values in each column.</p>
<p>Missing values (in ABV and IBU) were omitted due to several possible alternative circumstances. If we were to replace them with the median value, it would hold many statistics to their values (namely the median across all) but ethically would be unsound. We also could replace these values with zeroes when doing our calculations, which is more ethically right, but would skew the statistics.</p>

Beer.afna = Beer.afABVna[!is.na(Beer.afABVna$IBU),] #ALL NA omitted</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>cor(Beer.afna$ABV,Beer.afna$IBU) #correlation coefficient between ABV and IBU</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.6706215</code></pre>
<p>Seen in the above plots, there is in fact a relationship between IBU and ABV, shown with a linear model and best fit model. With a correlation coefficient of 0.67; this shows a strong positive correlation between the two.</p>
<p>##k-NN Classification</p>
<p>Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).<br />
You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship. Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.</p>

<p>We have a working k-NN model that can predict IPAs and Ales with 84% accuracy when using ABV and IBU as predictors. This is useful in market research in order to determine what kind of ABV and IBUs to use in order to target the most craft consumers.</p>
